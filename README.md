# Project "Nado Sdelat Idealno"
https://annabreamer.github.io/nado-sdelat-idealno/
## Overview
This project features a minimalistic design with a full-screen background video, a headline, and a tooltip that appears on hover over the headline. Despite its simple appearance, I tackled complex styling challenges such as dynamic pseudo-elements, responsive layout adjustments, and precise video configuration. I built the entire HTML structure from scratch and applied advanced CSS techniques—including CSS variables and refined box-sizing rules—to achieve a pixel-perfect, engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5, CSS3** (responsive design, CSS variables, pseudo-elements)**, Git, Figma**
